favorite_foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "cool whip"]
# puts favorite_foods

# Accessing the array
# puts favorite_foods[0]
# puts favorite_foods[-1]

# Add to the array
favorite_foods.push("more tacos")
favorite_foods = favorite_foods + ["cookies"]
puts favorite_foods

puts favorite_foods.size
puts favorite_foods.count
puts favorite_foods.length
