# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 5 + 2
# puts 100.000000/10.000000




# Perform simple math with numbers

# Strings
# puts "Hello world"

# Combine strings together
# puts "Tacos are " + "awesome " + "and I love them."
# puts "tacos " * 3

# Variables
# a = 10
# b = 3
# x = 3 + 5
# puts x
# puts a * b

# food = "tacos"
# quantity = 3
# puts food * quantity

# Combine strings and variables
first_name = "Boba"
last_name = "Fett"
greeting = "Hello, #{first_name}" # this is called string interpolation
greeting = "Hello #{first_name} #{last_name}"
puts greeting

# String manipulation
puts 3.to_s # convert the argument to a string
puts "Hello".reverse
puts "Hello".length
puts "Hello".upcase
puts "Hello".downcase

if x = 8
